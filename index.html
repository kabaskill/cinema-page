          <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
          <p>
            Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob
            drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the
            powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon
            Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino),
            reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable
            cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a
            normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn
            deeper into the family business.

          <h3>12 Angry Men (1957)</h3>
          <p>
            Following the closing arguments in a murder trial, the 12 members of
            the jury must deliberate, with a guilty verdict meaning death for
            the accused, an inner-city teen. As the dozen men try to reach a
            unanimous decision while sequestered in a room, one juror (Henry
            Fonda) casts considerable doubt on elements of the case. Personal
            issues soon rise to the surface, and conflict threatens to derail
            the delicate process that will decide one boy's fate.
